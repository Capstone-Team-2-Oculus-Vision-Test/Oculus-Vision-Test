# Unity Test Project

This project uses the Unity VR project template, and documentation for it can be found [here](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/xr-template-vr.html).

Sample project to get familiar with how source control works in Unity projects. So far, it works pretty well. 

- [ ] Try adding elements to the project and cloning the repo again to see if the project can be run with only what's in the repository.
