# VR Visual Field Test
This project aims to create a visual field static perimetry test using Oculus Quest VR headsets as a cheaper and more widely available alternative to specialized machines like the Humphrey Visual Field Analyzer. It seeks to address current issues with VR implementations such as high costs and proprietary hardware. This project is created by our CSCE capstone group, in collaboration with one of the BMEG capstone groups.

## Overview
The VR Visual Field Test is a virtual reality application that allows users to perform a visual field test in a virtual environment. The application uses the Oculus Rift headset to create a 3D environment in which users can interact with. The visual field test is used to assess a patientâ€™s peripheral vision and detect any blind spots or other visual field defects.
